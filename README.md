Summary

In this case, it is clear that the naive Random oversampled and SMOTE oversampled with logistic regression models behave similarly, undersampleing with logistic regression model gave the least accuracy score of 0.5447339051023905, the combination sampled with logistic regression gave slighly less accuracy score 0.6446239777158258 than oversampled LR models.

The balanced Random Forest accuracy is 0.7885466545953005 accuracy, where the Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier accuracy is 0.9316600714093861 which makes the hogest among all.
